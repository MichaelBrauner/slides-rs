Quality requirements are organized according to the **[Q42 Quality Model](https://quality.arc42.org)** using 8 core properties.

---

## 10.1 Flexibility

System can be adapted to changes in requirements, contexts of use, or environment.

#### Extensibility

- [QS-001: Extensible Templates](quality-scenarios/QS-001_flexibility_extensibility.md)

#### Customizability

- [QS-002: Customizable Styles](quality-scenarios/QS-002_flexibility_customizability.md)

---

## 10.2 Usability

System enables users to safely and effectively accomplish their tasks.

#### Learnability

- [QS-003: Easy Onboarding](quality-scenarios/QS-003_usability_learnability.md)

#### Simplicity

- [QS-004: Minimal Configuration](quality-scenarios/QS-004_usability_simplicity.md)

---

## 10.3 Operability

System can be easily deployed, operated, monitored, and maintained.

#### Installability

- [QS-005: Single Binary Installation](quality-scenarios/QS-005_operability_installability.md)

#### Portability

- [QS-006: Cross-Platform Support](quality-scenarios/QS-006_operability_portability.md)

---

## 10.4 Efficiency

System produces desired results without wasting resources, time, or energy.

#### Build Performance

- [QS-007: Fast Builds](quality-scenarios/QS-007_efficiency_performance.md)

---

## 10.5 Suitable

System is fit for the intended purpose and context.

#### Interoperability

- [QS-008: Git and AI Friendly](quality-scenarios/QS-008_suitable_interoperability.md)

---

## 10.6 Maintainability

System can be easily understood, modified, and tested.

#### Understandability

- [QS-009: Clear Code Structure](quality-scenarios/QS-009_maintainability_understandability.md)

#### Testability

- [QS-010: Isolated Testable Functions](quality-scenarios/QS-010_maintainability_testability.md)

---

## Documentation Standards

Quality scenarios follow the **[ARC42 Extended Form (SEI/Bass+21)](https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/)** with 6 elements (Stimulus, Environment, Artifact, Response, Response Measure, Related).
